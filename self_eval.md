# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? 
* just about everything
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
* honestly, looking everything up seems to be better than note taking. but if i do note take, screen shotting is the way to go.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
* try it first, then i Google. unfortunaly my vocab needs some searious work so I can google better.
